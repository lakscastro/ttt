## NSD Package

This project was built on top of [nsd](https://github.com/sebastianhaberey/nsd) [package](https://pub.dev/packages/nsd) maintained by [@sebastianhaberey](https://github.com/sebastianhaberey) which I sincere thanks for the efforts to make this package accessible for everyone.

## How to install

### Releases Tab

Take a look at [`releases`](https://github.com/lakscastro/ttt/releases)

### Play Store

> Soon, if Google accept it.

## How to play

**Requirements:** You'll need two devices or a friend and the game installed on both to in order to play.

The first one needs to create a room (Click on <kbd>Create Room</kbd>) which will appear on the second device (Click on <kbd>Join Room</kbd>).

Then connect the second to the room created by first (Click over the room name) and click to start a match (Click <kbd>Next</kbd>).

Well, about the Tic Tac Toe rules I guess are pretty well-known, but just in case: [take a look at them](https://www.wikihow.com/Play-Tic-Tac-Toe).

## Motivation

I wanted to know to create an app which allow P2P communication over a local network. I often had ideas about spaceships, puzzle games and (g)old classic retro games re-implementations, but didn't even know how to create a connection between a device to another, so this project was just "a test" to take a look at how to do it.
